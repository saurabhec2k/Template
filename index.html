<h2 id="generative-ai">Generative AI</h2>

<p>Generative AI, also known as creative AI, is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate new content, such as text, images, audio, and code. This is in contrast to other types of AI, which are typically used to analyze or classify existing data.</p>

<p>Generative AI models are trained on large amounts of data, and they use this data to learn the patterns and relationships that exist within the data. Once a model has been trained, it can be used to generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>

<p>Machine learning algorithms are trained on large amounts of data, and they use this data to learn the relationships between inputs and outputs. Once a model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions about new data.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>

<p>Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain, and they consist of layers of interconnected neurons.</p>

<p>Deep learning models are able to learn complex patterns from data, and they have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>
